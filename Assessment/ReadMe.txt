What I learned:
Learning the python basics indirectly improved my matlab skills for kinetic modelling.
My goal was just to pick up basic coding skills to append to my msc degree to give myself extra
skills to solving chemical engineering problems but I found it improving my matlab skills too, so
that was pretty great.

What I would like to learn:
Honestly, everything.

Advanced track:
I would like to join the advanced track in block 2b.
